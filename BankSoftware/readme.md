# BankSoftware
**Student project for the first semester at FMI**

## **The project strives to imitate a bank software.**

- Not important note: I've begun the project too early and didn't use any more complex functionalities, as vectors, structures and so on...

### Prerequisites
  - The project is build without usage of only arrays and primite datatypes. Exception are hashing function, round function and one function with string.

### Notes
  - Every user has three features - name, password and ballance.
  - The program will detect always incorrect input.
  - The data for the users is stored in txt file, with colons as delimiters.
  - If you want to go back from every action you've choosen. Type only **-1** at the action and you will go to the previous menu.
  - The data for everything unless the registration will be overwritten only after you quit the file.
  - The programm accepts also low letters for the actions.

## Functionality

1. **Beginning Menu**
    - You can choose from the current options: Register, Login or Quit.

2. **Login**
    - First you enter your name. If the name is not right, you have three attempts, after this you will go to the beginning menu.
    - The same is with the password.
  
3. **Register**
    - The name should have only lattin letters and symbols without a colon.
    - In the password you should have at least 1 low letter, 1 high letter, 1 digit and 1 symbol and the length should be at least 5 characters.
    - After you've successfuly registered, the data will be stored in txt file with the hashed password.
    - After successful registration, you should login to your profile.

    - You can withdraw without limits, unless you exceed your max overdraft which is 10000 BGN.

6. **Transfer**
